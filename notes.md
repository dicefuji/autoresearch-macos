# Notes

## Purpose

This file is the running journal for the VC-associate autoresearch loop. Update it after baseline setup and after each meaningful experiment so the final retrospective can be written from this file alone.

## Active Run

### Run
- Tag: `apr21-vc`
- Date: `2026-04-21`
- Objective: Build a venture-capital associate that improves at spotting outlier founders in broad early-stage tech.
- Current best commit: `df3e588`
- Current best `val_bpb`: `2.095573`

### Current Founder Rubric
- Core founder signals to test: unusual ability, originality, speed, obsession, earned contrarian insight, execution proof
- Supporting evidence patterns: exceptional achievements, early signs of taste, difficult wins, technical or commercial leverage
- Negative signals: prestige without proof, shallow market understanding, consensus-chasing, weak execution evidence
- Open questions: which prompt and training changes most improve memo quality without degrading runtime; which signals are strongest for early founder prediction

### Latest Experiment
- Hypothesis: the baseline run will establish the runtime and starting quality envelope for later prompt and model iterations
- Change made: initialized `autoresearch/apr21-vc`, ran the untouched baseline on M1 Pro / MPS
- Result: `val_bpb 2.095573`, `training_seconds 316.7`, `total_seconds 1233.9`, `num_steps 17`
- Keep or discard: keep
- What this taught us about founder prediction: before chasing rubric quality, this setup needs much better experiments-per-hour; evaluation overhead currently dominates the overnight loop
- Next move: test a lower total batch size to reduce accumulation and improve iteration speed without changing the evaluation harness

## Retrospective Prompts

- Which founder signals became more predictive over time?
- Which obvious prestige markers turned out to be weak shortcuts?
- What kinds of contrarian thinking appeared repeatedly among strong candidates?
- What changes to prompts or training produced the biggest jump in memo quality?
- What should the next run test?

# Notes

## Purpose

This file is the running journal for the VC-associate autoresearch loop. Update it after baseline setup and after each meaningful experiment so the final retrospective can be written from this file alone.

## Active Run

### Run
- Tag: `apr21-vc`
- Date: `2026-04-21`
- Objective: Build a venture-capital associate that improves at spotting outlier founders in broad early-stage tech.
- Current best commit: `1ace239`
- Current best `val_bpb`: `1.639182`

### Current Founder Rubric
- Core founder signals to test: unusual ability, originality, speed, obsession, earned contrarian insight, execution proof
- Supporting evidence patterns: exceptional achievements, early signs of taste, difficult wins, technical or commercial leverage
- Negative signals: prestige without proof, shallow market understanding, consensus-chasing, weak execution evidence
- Open questions: which prompt and training changes most improve memo quality without degrading runtime; which signals are strongest for early founder prediction

### Latest Experiment
- Hypothesis: adding a small warmup and stopping the cooldown above zero would preserve the lower-LR win while improving optimization efficiency
- Change made: set `WARMUP_RATIO = 0.03`, `WARMDOWN_RATIO = 0.3`, and `FINAL_LR_FRAC = 0.15` on the lower-LR depth-3 checkpoint
- Result: `val_bpb 1.696098`, `training_seconds 301.0`, `total_seconds 595.5`, `num_steps 123`
- Keep or discard: discard
- What this taught us about founder prediction: the lower-LR depth-3 checkpoint wants a sharper schedule; the added warmup and nonzero tail smoothed the run but lost quality relative to the current best
- Next move: restore the lower-LR best checkpoint and try a more localized architectural throughput tweak instead of softer schedule changes

## Driver Run: 2026-04-21T16:17:00
- Commit: `374a6ec`
- Experiment: reduce total batch size to `2**15`
- Status: discard
- val_bpb: `2.152058`
- training_seconds: `323.9`
- total_seconds: `832.2`
- memory_gb: `0.0`
- Handoff note: faster wall-clock than baseline (`832.2s` vs `1233.9s`) but worse objective; do not keep this as the branch baseline

## Driver Run: 2026-04-21T16:28:00
- Commit: `f3d1f58`
- Experiment: reduce depth from `4` to `3`
- Status: keep
- val_bpb: `1.778950`
- training_seconds: `338.8`
- total_seconds: `665.6`
- memory_gb: `0.0`
- Handoff note: clear win on both objective and wall-clock; this is the new branch baseline

## Driver Run: 2026-04-21T16:41:00
- Commit: `9ff8709`
- Experiment: reduce head dimension from `128` to `64` at `DEPTH = 3`
- Status: discard
- val_bpb: `2.174275`
- training_seconds: `314.7`
- total_seconds: `938.7`
- memory_gb: `0.0`
- Handoff note: strong regression versus the depth-3 best; restore `HEAD_DIM = 128` before the next run

## Driver Run: 2026-04-21T16:58:00
- Commit: `1ace239`
- Experiment: lower `EMBEDDING_LR`, `MATRIX_LR`, and `SCALAR_LR` on the depth-3 checkpoint
- Status: keep
- val_bpb: `1.639182`
- training_seconds: `301.0`
- total_seconds: `574.9`
- memory_gb: `0.0`
- Handoff note: clear win on both objective and total wall-clock; this is the new branch baseline

## Driver Run: 2026-04-21T17:11:00
- Commit: `01726fa`
- Experiment: add a small warmup and a less aggressive cooldown on the lower-LR checkpoint
- Status: discard
- val_bpb: `1.696098`
- training_seconds: `301.0`
- total_seconds: `595.5`
- memory_gb: `0.0`
- Handoff note: final metrics did flush after an initial watcher miss; result is worse than the current best `1.639182`, so keep the lower-LR baseline

## Retrospective Prompts

- Which founder signals became more predictive over time?

- What kinds of contrarian thinking appeared repeatedly among strong candidates?
- What changes to prompts or training produced the biggest jump in memo quality?
- What should the next run test?
